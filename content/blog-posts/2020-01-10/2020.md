## Cool

Hi there üëã Happy New Year! ü•ÇüéÜ It's been a while since I've written anything but I'm back! My final fall semester got pretty busy, pretty fast. Semesters can feel like they'll never end and then BAM‚Äìyou're in finals week. I learned a lot about cloud computing (check out some projects [here](https://github.com/dilloncoffman/AWS-GatsbyRecordStore) and [here](https://github.com/dilloncoffman/FirebaseSongReview)), read some neat books I plan to write [notes](https://www.dilloncoffman.com/reading-notes) about, and watched [a pretty cool show](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B017APUY62/ref=atv_dp) I would highly recommend.

I was pretty disappointed that I didn't have much time to write anything between work and school, but I'm planning to make time to write for my last semester. These posts are cool to look back on and see what I might have been doing or thinking at any given time.

## A Pretty Good 2020 üë®‚Äçüéì

It's hard to believe this will be ***my last semester***! The year I enter the "real world" and get to paying back all these student loans üí∞ It's going to be a wild ride and I'm excited for what's to come. 

I'm planning to kickstart a couple projects and start sharing what I've learned over the years about web/mobile development, UX/UI design, and other random things I'm passionate about. Right now I'm in the process of redesigning this site and will be documenting the whole process. You can also expect some guitar tabs for songs I'm currently playing just because!
