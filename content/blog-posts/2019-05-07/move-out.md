## What am I working on?

Well for starters, I'm writing a shorter post this week for sake of study and packing time (sorry!ðŸ˜¢). When I decided to start writing weekly posts, I wanted to challenge myself to sit down once a week and write introspectively about the past week. Introspection is valuable in that it allows you to objectively analyze yourself â€“ your successes and your failures. That's mostly what these posts are about. It's also a matter of 'doing' for me as [Jocko Willink](https://twitter.com/jockowillink/status/1125407387878285312) would say. Before the start of 2019, I wasn't documenting as much as I would have liked to. I also wasn't reading physical books or working on personal projects that I've wanted to. It's because of introspection I decided to start making time for the things I wanted to do. Not that there's anything heroic or special about doing so â€“ it was all just for my own peace of mind. I think it's important that you keep a log of your own thoughts, whether or not you're doing so in a journal or online. Another plus is knowing I was going to have to write these posts kept me working, reading, and coding even when I didn't necessarily feel like it. Discipline is something you have to build and these posts are a part of that process for me.

Tomorrow is move-out! It's also the day I have two finals back-to-back.. but that's alright!ðŸš€ Due to studying, review sessions, and a neuroscience final last Thursday, I wasn't able to get as much done this past week as I would have liked. I read more about AWS Amplify authentication for [PlayRight](https://github.com/dilloncoffman/PlayRight) and decided to do everything without the higher-order component, but didn't find the time to do anymore coding on it. I did however learn more about Gatsby and GraphQL. Andrew Mead's [Gatsby bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM) is an awesome supplement to the Gatsby [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/). For fun I used what I learned about Gatsby and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to display a 'time to read' field on each blog post which is based off how much markdown is written. Check out the [`gatsby-transformer-remark`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#transforming-markdown--gatsby-transformer-remark) plugin to learn more about taking the markdown you write and using it as content on your own Gatsby site or web app.
