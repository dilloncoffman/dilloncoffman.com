Hey there! Welcome to my new site, as of Friday July 10th, 2020, I've published **this** brand new version of my personal site. For my developer friends out there, this site was built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), both wonderful OS projects you should definitely check out. You can view all the code for this site [here](https://github.com/dilloncoffman/dilloncoffman.com)! 

This site is a *work in progress* as noted by the empty [about](https://www.dilloncoffman.com/about) page.. yikes, but I promise it will have new and interesting content on it soon enough along with the rest of this [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). Now that I'm done with university and in this crazy real world, I can more easily set aside time without **surprise** assignments holding me back. Until I find the inspiration to sit down and write a new post, feel free to  reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_DillonCoffman_) or find guitar covers/jams on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_DillonCoffman_/). Hope you're staying safe and sane in these crazy times. I'll catch ya around shortly ðŸ˜Ž.

If you enjoy these posts and feel so inclined to support me, I would really appreciate it! Feel free to buy me a coffee ðŸ˜„
