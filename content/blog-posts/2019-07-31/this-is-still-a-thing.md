## Magic 🎇

It's been awhile.. a lot of things have happened in a little over three weeks. Probably the craziest thing that comes to mind is my dog got attacked by another dog while we were out on a walk. Don't worry, she's okay! Here's a picture of Daisy chilling in her inflatable donut of shame:

She's a resilient little creature and I'm glad she's okay🐕. The following weekend I got an email from Apple about a battery recall for 2015-2017 MacBook Pros, and so there went my computer for almost a week! Yesterday was my birthday so that's pretty neat 😎 and my internship is going well 👨‍💻 I spent a lot of time reading while my MacBook was away and got some guitar playing in. Check it:

## Code 👨‍💻

Outside of guitar, reading, and my internship I took some time this past weekend to learn about [Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/) and created my own with some static concert data. You can check out the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dilloncoffman/gatsby-theme-concerts) if you're interested! This was just to get familiar with Gatsby themes and I highly recommend [Jason Lengstorf's course](https://egghead.io/courses/gatsby-theme-authoring). My goal now is to make a theme for musicians/bands looking to start a 🆒 new website. The main features I plan to implement are:

- Keeping track of tours/shows using [SongKick's API](https://www.songkick.com/developer) and/or some sort of headless CMS like [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/why-contentful/) for bands to easily keep track of their info
- Selling schweet merchandise with Stripe
- Featuring social media accounts/streaming services where their music is available

What makes Gatsby themes so rad is that if someone wanted to add on to this list of features with say, a blog or perhaps tour podcast? They could easily [include a whole other theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/using-multiple-gatsby-themes) on their site alongside mine. I'm sure I'll think of other things to add in the future but for now that's my game plan!

## Quote I'm digging...

> “Some 2,600 years ago the ancient Greek poet Pindar wrote, “Become who you are by learning who you are.” What he meant is the following: You are born with a particular makeup and tendencies that mark you as a piece of fate. It is who you are to the core. Some people never become who they are; they stop trusting in themselves; they conform to the tastes of others, and they end up wearing a mask that hides their true nature. If you allow yourself to learn who you really are by paying attention to that voice and force within you, then you can become what you were fated to become—an individual, a Master.” - Robert Greene, _Mastery_
