## Update

I'm officially back in the flow of the day to day work grind! My internship is going well and I'm learning a ton, specifically when it comes to [React](https://reactjs.org/), [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), and testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/). I know I know, a lottt of buzzwords ‚Äì¬†I still have a lot to learn! On the side I'm still hacking away on a variety of things when I have time from my girlfriend's site to some [Design+Code](https://designcode.io/) React/React Native courses. Last week I spent some time with the fam on Father's Day and continued working on some new screen designs for [PlayRight](https://github.com/dilloncoffman/PlayRight).

## Dev Work

Over this past week I started contributing to a new project at work in React. While I'm still wrapping my head around using hooks, I'm getting the hang of it and it's been pretty rewarding to think things through and see them working (..sometimes üò¨). I hope to write a small tutorial on hooks soon to solidify what I've learned and maybe help someone else out! For now, I would highly recommend [this post](https://flaviocopes.com/react-hooks/) and of course [the docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). I also set up all the basic tests for the project so far to make sure everything is rendering properly. Luckily, Jest and Enzyme make testing your components easy! I've been using [JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as a dummy database with custom API endpoints to hit while getting things off the ground. In order to easily start up my development server, tests, and JSON-Server, I set up a script using [this awesome npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ttab). This week I'll continue to work on [Design+Code](https://designcode.io/) React/React Native courses. I'm hoping to learn more about React Native animations with [Lottie](https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/) and gestures. Eventually I'd like to use Adobe AfterEffects to create my own animations!

## Quote I'm digging...

> ‚ÄúWe are all in search of feeling more connected to reality‚Äìto other people, the times we live in, the natural world, our character, and our own uniqueness. Our culture increasingly tends to separate us from these realities in various ways. We indulge in drugs or alcohol, or engage in dangerous sports or risky behavior, just to wake ourselves up from the sleep of our daily existence and feel a heightened sense of connection to reality. In the end, however, the most satisfying and powerful way to feel this connection is through creative activity. Engaged in the creative process we feel more alive than ever, because we are making something and not merely consuming, Masters of the small reality we create. In doing this work, we are in fact creating ourselves.‚Äù ~ Robert Greene, Mastery
