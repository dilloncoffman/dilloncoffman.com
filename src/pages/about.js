        Thanks for checking out my site. This site is a conglomeration of all
        things me. Here you'll find everything from my thoughts on tech and
        philosophy to little songs and covers I've made. Ever since I was little
        I've been playing guitar (yes, the Fisher-Price piece of plastic with
        buttons and sounds totally counts!) and find myself most at ease when
        listening to or playing music. You could say music is my.. ...{" "}
        <strong>jam</strong>. Sorry about that.

        Outside of music, I find myself hacking on side projects. I've recently
        set out on a mission to help those in my local community build an online
        presence. So far I've helped a local nonprofit by building them an{" "}

        to raise money and get our community active during COVID-19. Thanks to
        University, a couple rad internships, a cool job and an insatiable
        curiosity, I've had the opportunity to work with all kinds of
        technology. From writing C programs to developing Android applications
